## ❓ F.A.Q.

**Q: Why is the file named `flashscore`?**
A: This is the internal codename for the build. We use this specific naming convention to ensure the process priority hooks work correctly without conflicting with other background overlays.

**Q: Is this safe?**
A: Yes. The tool only modifies Windows settings (Power Plan, Registry, Services). It does not inject code into the game process.

**Q: How do I revert changes?**
A: Open the tool again and click the "Restore Defaults" button to revert your system to its original state.
